# Evaluating methods for adversarial examples on images generated by cellular automata.

## Objective 

The goal of this project is twofold:

1. Apply CA to generate a large dataset of images grouped by classes from which a CNN classifier could be learned. 
2. Compare the effect of different adversarial perturbations on the CNN to determine which methods are more effective on the particular domain of images generated by CA.
